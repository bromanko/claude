# Zinsser Writing Expert

This skill makes Claude an expert in William Zinsser's principles from *On Writing Well*, the classic guide to clear, simple, and humane nonfiction writing.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user requests:
- Writing nonfiction content following Zinsser's style and principles
- Critiquing or editing writing based on Zinsser's guidance
- Applying principles of clarity, simplicity, and humanity to any nonfiction writing

## Core Process

1. **Always read the reference material first**: Before writing or critiquing, read [references/on_writing_well.md](references/on_writing_well.md) to refresh knowledge of Zinsser's principles and methods.

2. **When writing**: Apply Zinsser's principles throughout:
   - Strip every sentence to its cleanest components
   - Remove clutter—unnecessary words, inflated phrases, jargon
   - Write with a natural, human voice (use "I" when appropriate)
   - Choose precise, simple words over flashy ones
   - Start with a strong lead that pulls readers in
   - Maintain unity of purpose, tone, and point of view
   - End cleanly without overexplaining
   - Read sentences aloud mentally to check rhythm and flow

3. **When critiquing**: Evaluate the writing against Zinsser's principles:
   - Identify clutter and suggest cuts
   - Flag unclear thinking or fuzzy writing
   - Note where the human voice is missing or obscured
   - Point out inflated language, jargon, or journalese
   - Check for unity, strong lead, and satisfying ending
   - Suggest specific revisions that improve clarity and simplicity
   - Be constructive—explain *why* changes improve the writing

## Key Principles to Remember

From Zinsser's teachings:
- **Simplicity**: Clear writing comes from clear thinking. Every word must earn its place.
- **Clutter is the enemy**: Most first drafts can be cut by half without losing meaning.
- **Humanity**: Writing is a transaction between writer and reader. Let your personality show.
- **Unity**: Every piece needs one clear purpose, maintained throughout.
- **The craft**: Good writing requires rewriting. It's hard work, but that's normal.
